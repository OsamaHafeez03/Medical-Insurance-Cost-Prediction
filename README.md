🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning!

I recently completed a project where I built a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs based on key factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Here’s a quick overview of what I worked on:

🔍 Project Highlights
Data Analysis: Explored and visualized the relationships between features and insurance charges.

Feature Engineering: Transformed categorical data and engineered new features for better model performance.

Model Building: Trained Linear Regression.

Evaluation: Compared models using metrics like R² to select the best performer.

Key Insight: Smoking status and high BMI are the strongest predictors of increased insurance costs.

📊 Results
Achieved strong predictive accuracy, with the best model providing robust estimates for insurance costs.

The project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can help both insurers and customers understand the factors impacting medical expenses.
